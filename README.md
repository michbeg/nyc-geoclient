# NYC Geoclient Python Bindings

Python bindings for the REST [NYC Geoclient API][api].

  [api]: http://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api-beta

This version is a fork of a [fork](https://github.com/ResidentMario/nyc-geoclient) of the [original](https://github.com/talos/nyc-geoclient). The original version of this library is Python 2-only. It was lightly modified by ResidentMario for cross-version compatibility (fork 1). This last version was forked to update the init file and make sure the library is usable as a package.

You can install this version of the client using `pip` with `pip install git+git://github.com/michbeg/nyc-geoclient`.
